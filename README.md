# dieter-coupling-remind

Note:
dataprocessing folder only contains plotting scripts for standalone DIETER which Chris wrote for Gunnar's lectures. For plots used to process DIETER results of the coupled runs, it is in the REMIND repo (https://github.com/cchrisgong/remind-coupling-dieter) under dataprocessing DIETER_plots
